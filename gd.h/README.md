# gd.h

Windows headers for Geometry Dash. Originally copied from pie's textureldr.

# Usage

 * These require cocos2d-x headers. You can use [CappucinoSDK](https://github.com/andrenih/cappuccinoSDK/), the cocos2d-x headers from [textureldr](https://github.com/poweredbypie/textureldr), or your own.

 * Certain compile settings can and will mess up some of these headers. **Recommended compile settings are:** 
    - 32-bit
    - Release mode, maximum optimization for speed (o2)

 * You need to add both the `include/` directory and the root `gd.h` directory in your include path for this to work.
